      In 2025, renting smart means being aware of your finances and your needs. The rental market in India is becoming more dynamic with digital platforms, changing tenant expectations, and increasing transparency.

      1. **Plan your budget in detail**: Start with your monthly income. Subtract fixed costs like groceries, transport, and savings. Whatever is left is your rent capacity. Ideally, rent should not exceed 30% of your income.

      2. **Don‚Äôt be lured by flashy photos**: Always verify properties through virtual or physical tours. Rentlee offers 360¬∞ verified tours on many listings.

      3. **Look into suburbs or metro extensions**: Cities like Bengaluru, Pune, and Hyderabad have seen major rent drops in outskirts, thanks to metro line expansions.

      4. **Negotiate, especially during off-season**: Between Jan-March, many landlords are willing to drop prices or offer extra benefits like free internet or waived deposits.

      5. **Don‚Äôt ignore hidden costs**: Always ask about maintenance, society charges, electricity capping (especially in PGs), and furnishing conditions.

      6. **Explore co-living options**: If you‚Äôre a student or early professional, co-living is cost-effective and hassle-free. Platforms like Rentlee allow filtering based on co-living preferences.

      7. **Secure rental agreements**: A proper rental agreement safeguards your deposit and terms. Rentlee allows digital signing for safe record keeping.

      8. **Choose semi-furnished over fully furnished**: You can often rent cheaper and buy basic furniture online with discounts instead of paying premium rents.

      9. **Ask the neighbors**: Before finalizing, casually ask other residents about water issues, power cuts, internet quality, etc.

      10. **Be ready to move fast**: Good rentals go quickly. Keep soft copies of your documents ready to submit when you spot your perfect place.

      At Rentlee, our mission is to make renting more transparent, smarter, and safe. Our AI-based match system helps you discover properties that match your budget, lifestyle, and commuting needs.

      **Remember**: A good rental is not about price alone‚Äîit's about convenience, neighborhood, security, and clarity. Spend time browsing, ask questions, and choose smartly.

    Renting your first property in 2025 can be exciting‚Äîbut also overwhelming if you‚Äôre not prepared.
    With changing regulations and online platforms, understanding the process before you begin will help you avoid common mistakes and feel more confident.

    ## Step-by-Step Guide for First-Time Tenants

    ### 1. Understand Your Needs
    Before browsing properties, make a list of what matters most: proximity to college or workplace, budget, number of bedrooms, and required amenities (e.g., parking, internet, furnished).

    ### 2. Set a Realistic Budget
    Ideally, your rent should be no more than 25‚Äì30% of your monthly income. Also account for:
    - Security deposit (usually 1‚Äì3 months‚Äô rent)
    - Brokerage fees (if any)
    - Monthly utilities and maintenance

    ### 3. Explore Verified Platforms
    Avoid random Facebook groups or unverified classifieds. Platforms like Rentlee offer verified listings, secure messaging, and digital agreements.

    ### 4. Property Visits & Inspections
    Always inspect:
    - Water pressure
    - Electrical fittings
    - Internet availability
    - Natural light
    - Neighbors and noise levels

    Take photos during your visit so you can review later and have evidence of the property‚Äôs condition.

    ### 5. Understand the Rent Agreement
    Read the agreement thoroughly. Key things to check:
    - Lock-in period (minimum stay duration)
    - Notice period for vacating (usually 1 month)
    - Maintenance and repair clauses
    - Visitor rules (some societies limit guests)

    Avoid verbal promises. Insist that all terms (painting, furniture, appliances) be mentioned in the agreement.

    ### 6. Keep Copies & Receipts
    Always:
    - Get a signed rent agreement
    - Ask for rent payment receipts
    - Maintain email or chat records with your landlord

    ### 7. Don‚Äôt Hesitate to Ask Questions
    If you feel unsure about a clause, ask the landlord or consult a friend. It's your right as a tenant to understand what you're signing.

    ## Bonus Tips
    - Avoid cash payments.
    - Choose apartments with active Resident Welfare Associations (RWAs).
    - If you‚Äôre moving in with roommates, ensure everyone signs the agreement.

    Renting your first home is a milestone. Make it smooth and secure by being informed and using the right tools.
    Rentlee is designed to assist first-time renters by offering smart search tools, verified listings, and agreement templates that protect you.

    Happy renting!

  description: "Confused between a Paying Guest (PG) accommodation and an apartment? Here's a detailed comparison to help you decide.",
  author: "Sneha Kapoor",

  image: "/images/blog/pg-vs-apartment.jpg",
  content: `
    If you're moving to a new city for work or education, one of the first big decisions you'll face is: **Should I go for a PG (Paying Guest) or rent an apartment?**
    In 2025, the lines between these two options have blurred a little ‚Äî thanks to co-living startups and flexible rental platforms like Rentlee ‚Äî but the choice still depends heavily on your lifestyle, budget, and preferences.

    ## What is a PG?
    A Paying Guest accommodation is typically a room in someone‚Äôs home or a shared property where tenants (usually students or working professionals) pay rent to stay, often with food and housekeeping included.

    ## What is an Apartment?
    Renting an apartment means you lease the entire flat (either solo or with roommates), and take responsibility for rent, bills, and maintenance yourself.

    ## Key Comparison Table

    | Factor              | PG Accommodation         | Apartment Rental          |
    |---------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|
    | Privacy             | Low to Moderate           | High                       |
    | Flexibility         | Higher (monthly terms)     | Moderate to low (lock-in) |
    | Cost                | Usually lower              | Higher upfront cost        |
    | Furnishing          | Fully furnished            | Depends (can vary)         |
    | Food & Services     | Often included             | Not included               |
    | Visitors Allowed?   | Often restricted           | Usually flexible           |
    | Ideal For           | Students, Freshers         | Families, Working pros     |

    ## Things to Consider

    ### 1. **Your Budget**
    PGs generally cost between ‚Çπ5,000‚Äì‚Çπ15,000/month depending on city and amenities. Apartments might cost ‚Çπ10,000‚Äì‚Çπ40,000/month plus deposit and utilities.

    ### 2. **Lifestyle Preferences**
    - Need privacy or work from home? Apartment wins.
    - Want meals and laundry included? PG may suit you better.
    - Introverted or night owl? PG rules might frustrate you.

    ### 3. **Duration of Stay**
    PGs often offer flexible stays of 1‚Äì3 months. Most apartments require a **lock-in period** of 6‚Äì11 months.

    ### 4. **Who You‚Äôre Living With**
    In PGs, you often share space with strangers or multiple people. In apartments, you choose your own roommates ‚Äî or live alone if you can afford it.

    ## The 2025 Twist: Co-Living
    Co-living spaces (like Stanza, Zolo, Settl) offer a hybrid: fully furnished apartments with services like a PG but freedom like an apartment. These are a good middle ground for Gen Z and young professionals.

    ## Final Word
    There's no one-size-fits-all answer. Here's a quick cheat:
    - For short-term stays, tight budgets, and convenience ‚Üí Choose a **PG**.
    - For privacy, freedom, and long-term comfort ‚Üí Go for an **Apartment**.

    Rentlee supports both options ‚Äî browse verified PGs and apartments in your city, apply filters, and chat with landlords directly. Happy renting!

  content: `
## üèõÔ∏è Why You Must Know Your Rights as a Tenant

Renting a home isn‚Äôt just about monthly payments and agreements ‚Äî it‚Äôs a legal relationship between you and the landlord. In India, tenant rights are governed by the **Rent Control Acts** of respective states, and being aware of them protects you from exploitation.

---

## üîê Key Rights Every Tenant Should Know

### 1. **Right to a Written Agreement**
You are legally entitled to receive a **written rental agreement** with clear terms. It must mention:
- Rent amount and due date
- Duration of stay
- Security deposit
- Maintenance responsibilities
- Notice period for eviction

Verbal agreements are risky and not enforceable in disputes.

---

### 2. **Right to Privacy**
Once rented, the home is your personal space. The landlord:
- Cannot enter without prior notice.
- Cannot inspect the premises at random times.
- Must give reasonable time for maintenance visits.

---

### 3. **Right to Fair Rent**
Under the Rent Control Act, landlords cannot increase rent arbitrarily. A justified hike can occur only:
- After completion of the rental term.
- Within the state-specific limits (usually 10%‚Äì15% annually).
- With written prior notice.

---

### 4. **Right to Essential Services**
You cannot be denied:
- Water supply
- Electricity
- Access to shared amenities like lifts or parking

Even in disputes, landlords cannot disconnect these without court orders.

---

### 5. **Right to Security Deposit Refund**
At the end of your stay:
- Your security deposit must be refunded (minus legitimate repair costs).
- No deduction can be made without explanation or proof.
- In some states like Karnataka, the maximum deposit is capped at 2‚Äì3 months‚Äô rent.

---

## üëÆ What to Do If Your Rights Are Violated

- **Send a legal notice** if terms are broken.
- **File a complaint** with the local Rent Controller or Consumer Forum.
- **Document everything** ‚Äî chat records, rent receipts, agreement copies.

---

## üí° Pro-Tip: Always Sign Agreements Digitally
With platforms like Rentlee, you can create, sign, and store your rental agreement digitally ‚Äî ensuring it‚Äôs tamper-proof and easy to retrieve later.

---

## Final Thoughts

As a tenant in India, you‚Äôre not powerless. The law is on your side ‚Äî as long as you‚Äôre informed and assertive.

> üè† Renting a property is more than a transaction ‚Äî it‚Äôs a right.  
> Know it. Use it. Stand by it.

Rentlee is proud to simplify rental laws for you. We‚Äôre here not just to help you find a home, but to help you protect it too.

## ü§î Why Ask Questions Before Signing a Lease?

You‚Äôve found the perfect property. The photos look great, the price feels fair, and the neighborhood is just right. But before you rush to sign that lease ‚Äî **pause**.

Asking the right questions can prevent months of regret. A rental agreement is a legal commitment ‚Äî and understanding every term is your right.

---

## üìù The Top 10 Questions You Must Ask

### 1. **What Is Included in the Rent?**
Don‚Äôt assume everything is covered. Clarify:
- Maintenance charges
- Wi-Fi and cable
- Water and gas bills
- Parking fees

Sometimes ‚Äúfully furnished‚Äù excludes appliances or utilities.

---

### 2. **What‚Äôs the Notice Period and Lock-in Clause?**
Understand:
- Minimum stay (often 6‚Äì11 months)
- Notice period to vacate (usually 30 days)
- Penalties for early exit

This helps avoid conflicts when you want to move out.

---

### 3. **How Much Is the Security Deposit?**
Ask:
- How much? (Usually 1‚Äì3 months of rent)
- When will it be refunded?
- Under what conditions can deductions be made?

Always take a signed acknowledgment of deposit paid.

---

### 4. **Who Handles Repairs and Maintenance?**
If a geyser breaks or a light stops working, who pays?
- Some landlords cover only structural damage
- Tenant may be responsible for appliances and plumbing

Get it written in the agreement.

---

### 5. **Are There Restrictions on Guests or Pets?**
Some societies:
- Don‚Äôt allow overnight guests
- Have strict rules about pets
- Prohibit parties or loud music

Avoid awkward situations by asking upfront.

---

### 6. **What Is the Actual Carpet Area?**
Check the usable living area ‚Äî not just ‚Äúbuilt-up‚Äù size advertised online. This helps you judge furniture placement and room sizing realistically.

---

### 7. **Can I Decorate or Make Minor Changes?**
Ask if you can:
- Hang photos
- Install shelves
- Paint walls

Many landlords allow small changes if you restore them later.

---

### 8. **What Is the Rent Payment Process?**
Know:
- Due date every month
- Penalties for late payments
- Payment mode: UPI, bank, cash, Rentlee Pay, etc.

Also check if the rent is eligible for HRA tax exemption.

---

### 9. **Has the Property Been Rented Before?**
A little history helps. Was the previous tenant evicted? Why did they leave? It gives clues about maintenance, landlord behavior, or neighborhood safety.

---

### 10. **Can I Get a Copy of the Agreement to Read Before Signing?**
This is a right ‚Äî not a privilege. Ask for the lease to read at home. Cross-check:
- Name of landlord
- Correct rent and terms
- Signatures of all parties

---

## üí° Bonus Tips

- Click pictures before and after move-in.
- Get emergency contacts for plumber, electrician, etc.
- Visit at night once to judge safety and noise levels.

---

## Final Word

A lease is more than a document ‚Äî it's a blueprint for your stay. Asking these questions doesn't make you difficult ‚Äî it makes you **smart**.

> üß† Ask early. Read carefully. Live peacefully.

## üìù What Is a Rental Agreement?

A rental agreement is a legal contract between a landlord and tenant that outlines the terms and conditions of occupying a property. In India, it's typically valid for **11 months** to avoid mandatory registration under rent control laws.

But many tenants sign it without reading the fine print. That‚Äôs a huge risk.

---

## üßæ Clauses You Must Understand Before Signing

### 1. **Rent and Security Deposit**
- Clearly mention **monthly rent**, due date, and payment method.
- Security deposit (usually 1‚Äì3 months' rent) must also be stated.
- Ask if any portion is non-refundable.

---

### 2. **Lock-in Period**
- A lock-in clause prevents you from leaving before a set period (e.g. 6 months).
- If you leave early, you might **forfeit the deposit** or pay penalty rent.

---

### 3. **Notice Period**
- Most agreements require a 1-month notice before vacating.
- Same goes for landlords wanting to end the contract early.

> üìå Make sure the notice period is **equal for both sides**.

---

### 4. **Maintenance Charges**
- Is maintenance included in the rent?
- Or do you pay extra monthly to the RWA?
- Clarify who handles repairs, plumbing, and electrical faults.

---

### 5. **Utility Bills and Deductions**
- Specify who pays for:
  - Electricity
  - Water
  - Gas
  - Internet/Wi-Fi

> Avoid assumptions. List them in writing.

---

### 6. **Usage Restrictions**
- Some landlords don‚Äôt allow:
  - Pets
  - Smoking
  - Loud music or overnight guests

Check these in advance to avoid future friction.

---

### 7. **Furnishing Condition**
- Mention the list of furniture and appliances provided.
- Note their condition in the agreement (e.g. ‚ÄúTV in working condition‚Äù).

Take **photos before moving in** to avoid deposit disputes later.

---

### 8. **Early Termination Clause**
- What happens if you lose your job or shift cities?
- Ensure the clause allows for early exit with proper notice and nominal penalty.

---

### 9. **Renewal and Rent Hike**
- Rent can be increased annually (typically 5%‚Äì10%).
- Make sure the agreement specifies how and when rent will be revised.

---

### 10. **Dispute Resolution**
- Ideally, agreements should mention:
  - Jurisdiction (city/court)
  - How to resolve disputes (mutual arbitration or legal steps)

This avoids chaos in case things go south.

---

## ü§ù Why Negotiating Rent Is Normal (and Smart)

If you're a new renter in India, you may feel awkward asking for a rent reduction. But here‚Äôs the truth:

> **Most landlords expect negotiations.**

Whether it‚Äôs ‚Çπ500 off or 1 month rent-free, even small savings can make a big difference over time. The key is to negotiate **professionally and respectfully**.

---

## üí¨ When to Negotiate

- **Off-season** months (Jan‚ÄìMar, June‚ÄìJuly) when demand is lower
- If the property has been listed for over 3 weeks
- When you're ready to move in immediately
- During mid-month when landlords want to avoid a rent gap

---

## üéØ What Can You Negotiate?

### ‚úÖ 1. **Monthly Rent**
Ask for a ‚Çπ500‚Äì‚Çπ2000 discount if:
- The property has flaws (low floor, no lift, less sunlight)
- You‚Äôre renting long-term
- You‚Äôre a single tenant or working professional

---

### ‚úÖ 2. **Security Deposit**
Try to reduce it from 3 months to 2.  
Mention if:
- You have good references
- You're paying rent on time digitally
- The landlord is not offering bills/internet included

---

### ‚úÖ 3. **Maintenance Charges**
If it‚Äôs a new property or society charges are high, request partial coverage or exemption.

---

### ‚úÖ 4. **Furnishing or Add-ons**
You can ask for:
- A fan, gas stove, or table to be added
- Curtains, Wi-Fi router, or water purifier
- Basic paint/floor cleaning before move-in

These are low-cost for the landlord but helpful to you.

---

## üß† How to Negotiate ‚Äî Step by Step

### 1. **Be Polite and Informed**
Start with:
> ‚ÄúI really like the property. But I‚Äôd be more comfortable if we could work slightly on the rent‚Ä¶‚Äù

### 2. **Offer Value**
Mention:
- You're working/studying nearby
- You plan to stay for 1+ year
- You can move in immediately

### 3. **Show Market Research**
Say:
> ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen similar flats in this locality listed for ‚Çπ2000 less with similar features.‚Äù

This shows you‚Äôve done your homework.

---

## ‚ùå What NOT to Do

- Don‚Äôt be rude or aggressive  
- Don‚Äôt insult the property  
- Don‚Äôt lowball ridiculously (e.g., asking 40% off)  
- Don‚Äôt bluff if you‚Äôre not ready to close

---

- Filter by price, type, and furnishing

## üëØ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Roommates: A Blessing or a Budget Nightmare?

Sharing a flat with roommates is a great way to save money ‚Äî especially in metro cities. But without clear communication, things can turn messy.

Who pays the rent? What about groceries? What if someone moves out early?

This guide helps you split expenses **fairly and peacefully**.

---

## üè† Step 1: Choose Your Flatmates Wisely

You're not just sharing a home ‚Äî you're sharing bills, responsibilities, and space. Before signing a lease together, make sure:
- Your lifestyles match (e.g. sleep schedules, guests, cleaning)
- Everyone agrees on the budget and area
- No one has history of late payments or bad behavior

> Trust and transparency start before you move in.

---

## üí∏ Step 2: Decide How to Split Rent

### Option A: **Equal Split**
- Most common method
- Works best when all rooms are similar size

### Option B: **Based on Room Size**
- Master bedroom = more rent
- Smaller room = less rent

Use a tool like Splitwise or just sit down with a measuring tape.

---

## üßæ Step 3: Clarify All Shared Expenses

Rent isn't the only cost. Discuss how you‚Äôll split:
- Electricity & water bills
- Internet / Wi-Fi
- Groceries
- House help / cleaning
- Gas cylinder

Write it down and stick it on the fridge.

---

## üìÖ Step 4: Set Fixed Payment Dates

- Rent is usually due on the 1st of the month
- Bills may vary, but fix a shared date (e.g., 10th)
- Nominate one person to collect and pay from a shared wallet

> Use UPI apps like Google Pay or PhonePe with shared notes

---

## üìú Step 5: Make a Roommate Agreement

Yes, really. It doesn't have to be legal, but should mention:
- Who is responsible for what
- What happens if someone moves out early
- How to settle shared deposits and furniture costs

This avoids arguments when someone suddenly announces, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm leaving next week.‚Äù

---

## üõãÔ∏è Step 6: Divide Furnishing Costs Fairly

If you buy items together (fridge, utensils, furniture):
- Keep receipts
- Decide if you'll split ownership or settle later
- List who owns what

Alternatively, rent furniture via Rentlee‚Äôs tie-ups with furniture providers.

---

## üí° Bonus Tips

- Create a shared Google Sheet to track bills
- Always pay rent digitally for proof
- Don‚Äôt mix personal expenses (like Netflix) into the rent pool
- Respect shared spaces: kitchen, bathrooms, living room

---

## ‚ú® How Rentlee Helps Shared Rentals

- Filter properties by 2BHK, 3BHK suitable for sharing  
- View per-head rent estimates  
- Built-in expense tracking feature (coming soon!)  
- Shared digital rental agreements  

---

## Final Word

Living with roommates should be fun, not frustrating. A little planning goes a long way in keeping the peace (and the Wi-Fi working).

> üí¨ Communicate openly. Pay on time. Respect the fridge space.

Happy co-living,

## üõ°Ô∏è Why Property Verification Is More Important Than Ever

Fake listings. Ghost landlords. Advance payment scams.

If you‚Äôve ever searched for a rental in India, you‚Äôve probably heard a horror story or two. Rental fraud has grown with the rise of online classifieds ‚Äî and so has the need for **secure, verified platforms**.

That‚Äôs why Rentlee takes verification seriously.

> **90% of scams happen on unverified, unmoderated platforms.**

Let‚Äôs show you exactly how we make renting safer.

---

## ‚úÖ Step-by-Step: Rentlee‚Äôs Property Verification Process

### üì§ 1. **Manual Listing Review**
Every new listing submitted on Rentlee goes through:
- Image quality checks
- Duplicate listing detection
- Keyword analysis (e.g., ‚Äúno broker‚Äù vs ‚Äúowner posted‚Äù)
- Phone/email verification of the uploader

If anything feels off, we **reject** the listing ‚Äî no exceptions.

---

### üìû 2. **Phone Verification With the Owner**
Before going live:
- Our team **calls the property owner or agent**
- We verify ownership details, rent terms, and location
- Listings without a **valid contact** are never approved

We don‚Äôt just rely on forms ‚Äî we make actual calls.

---

### ü™™ 3. **ID + Ownership Document Checks (for Featured Listings)**
Featured or promoted listings must provide:
- Government-issued ID (Aadhaar, PAN)
- Property tax receipt or electricity bill
- Proof of ownership (registry or rent deed copy)

These are manually cross-checked by our backend moderation team.

---

### üó∫Ô∏è 4. **Geo-Tagging & Map Validation**
Our system matches:
- Submitted locality ‚Üí to valid geo-coordinates
- Nearby landmarks ‚Üí to map APIs
- Image background (building, signboard) ‚Üí to Google Street View

If the listing location doesn‚Äôt match reality, it‚Äôs flagged.

---

### üè∑Ô∏è 5. **Verified Badge = Extra Trust**
Listings that clear all checks are marked with a:
> ‚úÖ **‚ÄúVerified by Rentlee‚Äù** badge  
> üìç Optional: ‚ÄúVerified + Visited‚Äù if someone from our team has seen the site

This badge tells renters:  
**‚ÄúThis property has been double-checked ‚Äî it‚Äôs real.‚Äù**

---

## üö´ Common Scam Listings That Rentlee Rejects

- Unrealistic rent (e.g. ‚Çπ4,000 for a 2BHK in Delhi)  
- Agents pretending to be owners  
- Properties with only 1 blurry image  
- Listings without proper address or phone number  
- ‚ÄúAdvance ‚Çπ5,000 to lock flat‚Äù without meeting

> We block hundreds of listings like these every week.

---

## üîê Why It Matters to YOU

When you use Rentlee:
- You avoid **time-wasting visits** to fake places
- You never have to **pay before inspection**
- You know the listing was **checked by a real human**
- You can **chat safely** without giving out your number

## üí∞ More Than Just Rent: The Full Picture

When you see a flat listed for ‚Çπ12,000/month, that seems manageable.

But wait... have you considered:
- The security deposit?
- Maintenance?
- Utility bills?
- Internet? Movers?

Welcome to the **true cost** of renting in India. It‚Äôs more than you think ‚Äî but planning ahead can help you avoid last-minute shocks.

---

## üßæ 1. Security Deposit

Most landlords ask for **1‚Äì3 months of rent** upfront as a refundable deposit.

- For ‚Çπ12,000 rent, you may need ‚Çπ24,000‚Äì‚Çπ36,000 ready before moving in
- Some cities (like Bengaluru) used to demand 10 months ‚Äî now capped at 2 months due to reforms

> **Tip:** Always get the deposit terms in writing ‚Äî and ask about deductions.

---

## üßπ 2. Maintenance Charges

Flats in societies usually charge:
- ‚Çπ500‚Äì‚Çπ3,000/month for security, lift, cleaning

Some owners include it in rent. Always ask:
> ‚ÄúIs maintenance included or extra?‚Äù

- Bed, mattress, wardrobe
- Fridge, washing machine
- Cookware, curtains, cleaning items

This can cost **‚Çπ15,000 to ‚Çπ60,000** ‚Äî unless you're renting short-term and okay with second-hand.

---

## üöõ 5. Brokerage (If Applicable)

If you're renting through an agent, expect:
- 1 month‚Äôs rent as brokerage fee (sometimes negotiable)

Avoid brokers if possible by using verified platforms like **Rentlee**, where most listings are **direct from owners**.

Some landlords ask tenants to bear stamp paper costs:
- Around ‚Çπ300‚Äì‚Çπ500 for 11-month agreement

## üö® The Rise of Rental Scams in India

With more renters moving online, scammers are also getting smarter. From fake listings on social media to agents demanding money before a visit ‚Äî rental fraud is a growing concern.

In 2024 alone, hundreds of renters reported:
- Paying advance rent to fake owners
- Visiting non-existent flats
- Getting locked out of homes due to invalid agreements

Let‚Äôs make sure **you don‚Äôt become one of them.**

---

## üîç 1. The Rent Is Too Good to Be True

A 2BHK in South Delhi for ‚Çπ5,000/month?  
A furnished flat in Bandra for ‚Çπ7,000?

**If it looks too good to be true, it probably is.** Scammers attract interest by posting unbelievable deals. Always compare prices for that locality before responding.

> Use Rentlee‚Äôs filters to view verified market trends and avoid traps.

---

## üñºÔ∏è 2. Low-Quality or Stolen Photos

Scam listings often use:
- Pixelated or stock photos
- Pictures copied from hotel websites
- Exterior shots only (no interior)

**Do a reverse image search on Google** to check if the same image appears elsewhere.

---

## üìû 3. No Direct Contact or Pressure to Pay in Advance

Scammers will often:
- Ask you to ‚Äúlock the deal‚Äù with a small token
- Avoid video calls or in-person meetings
- Claim they‚Äôre abroad or in the army (common scam story)
- Use urgency like ‚Äú10 people are interested!‚Äù

üö´ **Never pay anything without visiting.** Real landlords don‚Äôt force you to book before a visit.

## üßæ 4. No Proper Documentation

Before paying rent or deposit, always ask for:
- Rent agreement draft
- Owner ID proof (Aadhaar/PAN)
- Property documents (if needed)

Scammers can‚Äôt provide these or will delay sharing them.

> Rentlee handles documentation digitally and securely ‚Äî **no WhatsApp forwards** required.

---

## üìç 5. Location Mismatch

If the ad says ‚ÄúKoramangala‚Äù but the map shows a village ‚Äî be cautious.

Use tools like:
- Google Maps
- Street View
- Rentlee‚Äôs built-in location filter

To validate the address before setting up a visit.

---

## üßë‚Äçüíº 6. Broker Posing as Owner

Some agents falsely post as ‚Äúdirect owner‚Äù to get more leads ‚Äî then push you to visit multiple flats and charge 1-month brokerage.

Ask clearly:
- ‚ÄúAre you the owner?‚Äù
- ‚ÄúWill I pay any broker fee?‚Äù
- ‚ÄúCan I speak directly with the landlord?‚Äù

> Rentlee displays **verified owner/agent status** on each listing.

---

## ‚úÖ 7. Use Verified Platforms

Avoid posting or responding to:
- Instagram DMs
- Telegram groups

Stick to:
- Platforms like **Rentlee**

## üì¶ Ready to Move Into a New Rental? Read This First.

You found the perfect rental on Rentlee. You‚Äôve packed your bags. Moving day is here.
